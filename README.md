# chatterbox

Made a simple chat application

- Can chat one to one
- Read receipts, similar to that of WhatsApp (Single tick, Double tick, Blue tick)
- Firebase Auth

You can chat [here](https://chatterbox-f1da5.firebaseapp.com/login)

### I took help from

- YouTube, StackOverflow for presence and read receipts implementation ideas
- ChatGPT, Gemini and CoPilot for coding
- This [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-chat-elements) for some chat components
